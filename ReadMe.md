This is a sample of an e-commerce website that will help people with small businesses to have a catalogue of the items they sell. 
It will save them time as some of them are used to going live on TikTok and sharing all the stocks physically ending up not displaying all. 
It will improve their marketing strategy as they will direct clients to their website for easier viewing of the items. 
Clients will then have a good time when selecting the items they want plus their delivery address.# SportsHouseE-commerce
